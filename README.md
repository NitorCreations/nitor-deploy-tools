## Released version 1.60

Nitor deploy tools are a set of tools to implement a true Infrastructure As Code workflow
with AWS and CloudFormation.

## Rationale

We at Nitor are software engineers with mostly a developer or architect background, but
a lot of us have had to work closely with various Operations teams around the world.
DevOps has a natural appeal to us and immediately "infrastructure as code" meant for us
that we should apply the best development practices to infrastructure development. It starts
with version control and continues with testing new features in isolation and a workflow
that supports this. Our teams usually take into use a feature branch workflow if it is
feasible and we expect all of the tools and practices to support this. For infrastructure
this type of branching means that you should be able to spin up enough of the infrastructure
to be able to verify the changes you want to implement in production. Also the testing
environment should be close enough to the target environment for the results to be valid.
So the differences between testing and production environments should be minimized and
reviewable.

With the popular tools like Ansible, Terraform, Chef etc. you need to come up with and
implement the ways to achieve the goals above. As far as I know, no tool besides ndt
has at it's core a thought-out way of a branching infrastructure development model.

## What it is

nitor-deploy-tools works by defining _Amazon Machine Images_, _Docker containers_,
_Serverless services_ and deploying _[CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)
stacks_ of resources.

## Installation

```
pip install nitor-deploy-tools
```
On OSX you may need to add `--ignore-installed` to get around platform installed versions
of `six` and other packages.

## Getting started

To use nitor-deploy-tools you need to set up a _project repository_ that
describes the images you want to build, and the stacks you want to deploy them in. See
[ndt-project-template](https://github.com/NitorCreations/ndt-project-template)
for an example.

Here are few commands you can use. All of these are run in your project repository root.
You need to have AWS credentials for command line access set up.

* To bake a new version of an image: `ndt bake-image <image-name>`
* To build a new Docker container image `ndt bake-docker <component> <docker-name>`
* To deploy a stack:
  * with a known AMI id: `ndt deploy-stack <image-name> <stack-name> <AMI-id>`
  * with the newest AMI id by a given bake job: `ndt deploy-stack <image-name> <stack-name> "" <bake-job-name>`
* To undeploy a stack: `ndt undeploy-stack <image-name> <stack-name>`

## Versioning

This library uses a simplified semantic versioning scheme: major version change for changes
that are not backwards compatible (not expecting these) and the minor
version for all backwards compatible changes. We won't make the distinction between
new functionality and bugfixes, since we don't think it matters and is not a thing
worth wasting time on. We will release often and if we need changes that are not comptatible,
we will fork the next major version and release alphas versions of that until we are
happy to release the next major version and try and have a painless upgrade path.
